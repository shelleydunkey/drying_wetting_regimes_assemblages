# drying_wetting_regimes_assemblages
Data and code used in paper: Drying and wetting regimes determine assemblage structure of macroinvertebrates, soft-bodied algae, and diatoms in non-perennial streams 

Includes code to:
1. calculate hydrologic metrics from logger data
2. calculate basic metrics from taxonomic matrices
3. run nmds
4. run linear linear models

Data includes:
1. Loggers_All_Data: logger data from each site
2. Report_FieldResult / Report_HabitatResult / Report_LabResult: field chemistry, habitat data, and lab chemistry data for each sample period (also available through the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN, www. Ceden.org))
3. Report_Algae / Report_Macroinvertebrates: soft=bodied algae, diatoms, and benthic macroinvertebrate data (before taxonomic resolution; also available through the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN, www. Ceden.org))
